      <a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/metallurgical-engineering.html"><h2>1.Metallurgical Engineering </h2></a>
      <div id="divcontent">
<p class="maroon"> Metallurgical Engineering majorly deals with all sorts of metal related fields. Apart from basics of engineering, metallurgical course equips students with knowledge of making, designing& manufacturing of various metal products, which range from cars and bikes to buildings and planes. Here, some major areas of studies include Hydrometallurgy, Heat treatment of steels, Mechanical andWelding metallurgy and so on.Extractive metallurgy, Physical metallurgy, and Mineral processing, train students with ability to extract metal from ore, gathering mineral products from earth’s crust and other problem solving abilities. These three are considered to be the major branches of Metallurgical Engineering.
Despite of the fact that there are very few seats in our country for studying the same, still there is good employment scope for graduates of this discipline. Apart from huge scope in Research and Development of metallurgy, the marketing departments of various firms look for Metallurgical engineers. So in short, any metallurgical company that deals with manufacturing, making, and refining of metal hires graduates from this stream.</div>

 <a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/mining-engineering.html"><h2> 2.Mining Engineering </h2></a>
 	<br> <div id="divcontent"> <p class="maroon"> Mining engineering is the science of extraction and processing of essential natural minerals from the environment. This discipline involvesthe theory, the practice, the technology, the science, and the application of extracting and processing minerals from a naturally occurring setting. Mining engineering also includes processing minerals for additional value. So, a mining engineer learns the technology and theory of mineral extraction without causing any harm to the surroundings where the extraction activity takes place. The mining engineers are not only supposed to extract and process minerals,nonetheless it is required of them to do the same in a responsible manner without affecting the environment due to the activity. Thus the mining engineering contributes a lot in tapping a country’s natural resources and in the process helps in the growth of the economy.</p></div>
<a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/aeronautical-engineering.html"><h2> 3.Aeronautical Engineering</h2> </a>
<br><div id="divcontent"> <p class="maroon"> Aeronautical engineering is the specialized branch of engineering for the aviation industry. This discipline involves studying, construction,designing,and science of the airplanes and other space crafts.Aeronautics branches uses the science of propulsion and aerodynamics. To become a successful engineer in Aeronautics, you must be alert, must have an eye for detail, and possess a high level of mathematical precision for success. This is so because the development and manufacturing of a flight vehicle is extremely complex and demands a careful balance and compromise between abilities, available technology,design, and costs involved. This branch mainly deals with the business, technology, and other aspects related to aircraft. A significant part in aeronautics engineering is a branch of physical science called aerodynamics, which deals with motion of air and the way in which it interacts with objects in motion, like an aircraft.</p></div>

<a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/chemical-engineering.html"><h2>4.Chemical Engineering</h2></a>
 <br> <div id="divcontent"><p class="maroon"> Chemical Engineering is that branch of engineering, which is concerned with the design, creation, and operation of machines and plants, which perform chemical reactions to solve practical problems, or make useful products. This Chemical Engineeringdiscipline deals with the application of mathematics, physical science and life sciences, to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms. Chemical Engineers use maths, physics and economics to solve technical problems. These guys design and invent new processes. The Chemical Engineers are employed by almost all companies in the chemical process industry. They can find jobs in petrochemical industries, chemical industries, manufacturing plants, research Institutes, mining industries, and Natural Gas industry etc.</p>

<a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/agricultural-engineering.html"><h2>5.Agricultural engineering</h2></a>
<br><div id="divcontent"> <p class="maroon"> Agricultural engineering deals with the science and technology of producing food grains. This discipline applies engineering science and technology to agricultural production and processing. It also combines the disciplines of plant Agricultural engineeringbiology,animal biology and mechanical, electrical,civil, and chemical engineering principles,along with the knowledge of agriculture principles. Basic areas and activities that constitute the discipline are design of agricultural machinery, agricultural resource management, equipment and agricultural structures, surveying and land profiling, soil management and conservation including erosion and erosion control, climatology and atmospheric science, seeding, livestock production, tillage, harvesting and processing of crops and waste management to name a few. Here in India, agricultural engineeringdepartment was initiated by IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) -Kharagpur in the year 1952, based on the recommendation of the Dhar Committee.</p></div>

<a href="https://www.askiitians.com/exams/engineering-branches/information-technology-engineering.html"><h2>6.Information Technology Engineering </h2> </a>
<br> <p class="maroon">
Information Technology is an engineering divisionthat concentrates on the study of utilizing computers and telecommunications in order to control- gather- store and circulate info. Both software and hardware sectors are parts of Information Technology EngineeringInformation Technology. Owing to the importance and reputation of IT, present age is sometimes referred to as information technology era. IT represents a vast category of career options that are based on designing, processing, developing, supporting or managing computer and web-based technologies and devices,which constitute IT networks. The modern world is entirely IT-dependent with Information Technology applications present in nearly every aspect of our lives. Thus this translates into a wide variety of career opportunities in this arena, both for fresh and experienced IT professionals alike.
